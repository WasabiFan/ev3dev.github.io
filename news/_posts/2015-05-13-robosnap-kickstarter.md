As if today was not historic enough, while I was busy preparing the first ever
[ev3dev Raspberry Pi release], fellow ev3dev contributor @sharived was busy
launching a [KickStarter page] for [RoboSnap] - the first ever product built
for ev3dev.

[RoboSnap] is an easy-to-use, kid-friendly USB camera made especially to work with
LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 (using ev3dev of course) as well as Raspberry Pi and other
platforms.

Beyond the camera itself, the project is bringing Snap! and Scratch (visual
programming languages) to ev3dev, so this is a project worth supporting even
if you are not interested in the camera.
