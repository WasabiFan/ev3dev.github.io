This is a test page.

*   {: data-platform-attribute-value="Android"}
    1.  This is the first step for Android.

    2.  This is the second step for Android.

*   {: data-platform-attribute-value="Mac OSX"}

    1.  Another step! This one's for Mac.

    2.  ...And another for Mac.

*   {: data-platform-attribute-value="Ubuntu"}

    1.  Even more steps! Now featuring 100% more Ubuntu.

    2.  Steps continued.

*   {: data-platform-attribute-value="Windows"} I give up. Just imagine there are steps here.
{: data-platform-select-list-attribute="client-platform" }

*   {: data-platform-attribute-value="EV3 Brick"}
    On the EV3, do a thing in this specific way.

*   {: data-platform-attribute-value="BrickPi"}
    The BrickPi is a little different. You actually need to do this other thing.

*   {: data-platform-attribute-value="PiStorms"}
    The PiStorms doesn't support this portion of the functionality.
    You need to take this into consideration.
