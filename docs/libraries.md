If you are looking to write a program that takes advantage of the EV3's motors, sensors, or other native devices,
using a language binding is the way to go.
We have a repository of officially maintained language bindings, as well as many more that are maintained separately by contributors on GitHub.

## Unified Libraries

Our official "unified" [language binding repository](http://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev-lang)
supports multiple implementations of the ev3dev API in a variety of languages.

* Unified bindings:
    * [C++](https://github.com/ddemidov/ev3dev-lang-cpp)
    * [Node.js](https://github.com/wasabifan/ev3dev-lang-js)
    * [Python](https://github.com/rhempel/ev3dev-lang-python)
    * [@mob41's ev3dev-lang-java](https://github.com/mob41/ev3dev-lang-java)

## Programming toolkit for ev3dev

There is also a [GLib]/[GObject] based [toolkit][ev3devKit] that provides a number of
programming interfaces for ev3dev, including user interface and device driver
interface.  It is written in vala, but since it uses GObjects, it can be used
with many [languages] via [GObjectIntrospection]. The [Brick Manager][brickman]
for ev3dev is written using this library.

## Extra languages
We also have many great contrubutors that are maintaining extra libraries for
languages not included in our other repository.  Note that some of these
libraries may be outdated due to the fast development pace of ev3dev.

* Extra languages:
    * [Go](https://github.com/ldmberman/GoEV3) updated for ev3dev-jessie by @ldmberman, [original](https://github.com/mattrajca/GoEV3) by @mattrajca
    * [Go](https://github.com/ev3go/ev3dev) closely following the ev3dev API specification by the @ev3go project.
    * [Java](https://github.com/ev3dev-lang-java/ev3dev-lang-java) an interface similar to that of LeJOS by @jabrena
    * [Python](https://github.com/topikachu/python-ev3) by @topikachu
    * [C (with optional Perl, Python and Ruby bindings)](https://github.com/in4lio/ev3dev-c) by @in4lio
    * [C](https://github.com/theZiz/ev3c) by @theZiz
    * [Clojure](https://github.com/annapawlicka/clj-ev3dev) by @annapawlicka
