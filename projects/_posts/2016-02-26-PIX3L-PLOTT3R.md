excerpt: "This is a pixel plotting robot made with a LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3. It accepts any image file." 
---

The PIX3L PLOTT3R is a LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robot that will print images. It will accept any image file (including jpeg and png). Images around 80 pixels width look the best. At the moment, images that are RGB, and B&W can be automatically processed by the code. The printer is approximately the size of a US Letter paper (8.5"W X 11"H). A user inferface allows someone to draw any image they want and/or type text.  In addition, each user's file is maintained in a queuing system that allows us to manage a large number of printing requests. 

The project page will be updated as additional features are added.
